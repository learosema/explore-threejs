# Exploring THREE.js

In this repository, I'm going to explore the THREE.js 3D engine.

For now, I am digging my way through the resources available at the official [documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)
and the [ThreeJS Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org) lessons.

# Demos

* [Hello Cube](hello-cube/) ([origin](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html))
* [Checker Board](checker-board/)

# Running this repo

This project uses the ES module syntax without Webpack or Babel. So, a modern browser is required (basically, not Internet Explorer 11). Also, I put a minimalistic static node express web server into the repo (use `npm install` and `npm start`). You can use any web server you like. 

This site is also being deployed as a [GitHub Page](https://terabaud.github.io/explore-threejs/).
